Gene dysfunction in disease is frequently studied through a systems biology framework. It is common to look to the transcriptome as a measure of the activity of the genes in the system. Gene expression changes are detected through differential expression, and then systems-level signals are evaluated either through gene set enrichment or network analyses.
