Sexual dimorphic traits are the result of not only the genes on the sex chromosomes, but also the transcriptional and regulatory networks these genes control and are controlled by. Deciphering these networks will be instrumental in understanding the influence of genetic variants in autoimmune diseases, where we find male and female differences in disease presentation, penetrance and prevalence.
