abstract: "Despite increasing sequencing capacity, genetic disease investigation still frequently results in the identification of loci containing multiple candidate disease genes that need to be tested for involvement in the disease. This process can be expedited by prioritizing the candidates prior to testing. Over the last decade, a large number of computational methods and tools have been developed to assist the clinical geneticist in prioritizing candidate disease genes. In this chapter, we give an overview of computational tools that can be used for this purpose, all of which are freely available over the web."
